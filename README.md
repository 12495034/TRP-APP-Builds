Released versions of Rapid HIV &amp; Syphilis testing mobile app

Thanks to https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-apps-from-unknown-sources-android/ for the process

This repository exists to facilitate user testing of a Rapid HIV & syphilis test booking system developed for the rainbow project.
Only production released apk's are stored in this repository.

Since Android 8.0, the method to install apps from unknown sources has changed. Instead of the previous method where you gave permission to download APKs through an existing app on your phone, the newer installation method requires you to give permission to specific apps that are allowed to install APKs from unknown sources. Let’s check the steps for different Android versions to grant this permission.

## Install Apps from Unknown Sources in Android 10, 11, and 12

1. Open Settings on your phone.
2. Go to “Apps,” then tap on “Special app access.” If you don’t find it, go to “Advanced” followed by “Special app access.”

4. Tap on the app you will use to install the third-party apps. This is usually a browser or the Files app. We’re using Chrome for this example.
Enable the toggle next to “Allow from this source.”
