## Recieved Email invitation to perform app testing

2. Click on the download link provided in the testing invitation email.
3. When prompted if you want to download the file again, select 'Download Again' as the apk will be a new version
4. Select the apk to install
5. When prompted 'Do you want to install this application?', select 'INSTALL'
6. A prompt may appear 'Unsafe app blocked'. This occurs as 'Google play' is not aware of the app or its developer. Expand 'More details' and press 'install anway'

Thanks to https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-apps-from-unknown-sources-android/ for the process

Since Android 8.0, the method to install apps from unknown sources has changed. Instead of the previous method where you gave permission to download APKs through an existing app on your phone, the newer installation method requires you to give permission to specific apps that are allowed to install APKs from unknown sources. Let’s check the steps for different Android versions to grant this permission.

## Allow Installation of Apps from Unknown Sources in Android 10, 11, and 12

1. Open Settings on your phone.
2. Go to “Apps,” then tap on “Special app access.” If you don’t find it, go to “Advanced” followed by “Special app access.”

3. Tap on “Install unknown apps.”

4. Tap on the app you will use to install the third-party apps. This is usually a browser or the Files app. We’re using Chrome for this example. However, if you were invited via email then the 'Email' app you use should be toggled aswell.
